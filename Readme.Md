# IAM User Management with Python and Boto3

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create, manage, and delete IAM users in AWS using Python and the Boto3 library. It also includes functionality to attach policies to IAM users, making it a comprehensive solution for managing IAM resources programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts in this project, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Boto3**: Install the Boto3 library using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install boto3
  ```
- **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should be configured with the appropriate permissions to manage IAM users. Follow the [AWS CLI configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) if needed.

## Features

- **Create IAM Users**: Automate the creation of new IAM users.
- **List IAM Users**: List all IAM users in your AWS account.
- **Delete IAM Users**: Delete specified IAM users.
- **Attach Policies to Users**: Attach predefined policies to IAM users to grant specific permissions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iam-user-management.git
cd iam-user-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Boto3 installed:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 3. Running the Script

To create, list, delete IAM users, and attach policies, you can use the functions provided in `iam_management.py`. Here's an example of how to use the script:

1. **Create an IAM user**
2. **List all IAM users**
3. **Attach an existing policy to the user**
4. **Delete the IAM user**

### 4. Customization

You can extend this project by adding the following features:
- **Detach Policies**: Functionality to detach policies from users.
- **Group Management**: Functions to create and manage IAM groups.
- **Password Management**: Automate password management for IAM users.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for common issues like missing or incomplete credentials. Make sure to review the error messages and take appropriate action if an issue arises.
